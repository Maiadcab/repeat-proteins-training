## Overview

Lesson development for training in Tandem Repeat proteins is based on four simple recommendations [1](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-876/v1). We are adopting the Carpentries philosophy and policy 
for developing and maintaning training material to help us in providing clear guidelines on how to implement the 4OSS recommendations.
1. Make source code publicly accessible from day one
1. Adopt a licence and comply with the licence of third-party dependencies
1. Define clear and transparent contribution, governance and communication processes
1. Make software easy to discover by providing software metadata via a popular community registry
